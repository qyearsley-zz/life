# Life

A very simple implementation of [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Building and running the unit test requires installing gtest headers to
be available. If the location is somewhere else besides /usr/src/gtest,
then Makefile will have to be updated before building.
